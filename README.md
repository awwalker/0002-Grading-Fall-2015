Test Files for HW Assignments in the NYU Intro to Computer Programming Class

Fall 2015 taught by Professor Joe Versoza

## Uses

Starting at assignment #5 students were required to implement functions in their code. As it became increasingly difficult to check code by running files multiple times  trying different inputs in an attempt to catch errors it made more sense to create test scripts. 

Each of the scripts is placed in a folder denoting which assignment it was created for and was created with the Python library, unittest. 
 
At some point I may also include the exercises that students were attempting that justified the creation of these scripts.
